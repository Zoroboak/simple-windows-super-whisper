# Windows Whisper - Development Diary

## Project Overview
Windows Whisper is a desktop application that provides real-time speech-to-text transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model. The application runs in the background and can be activated via hotkeys to transcribe speech from any audio source.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Features
#### Week 1
- ✅ Created Python virtual environment
- ✅ Set up basic project structure
- ✅ Implemented audio recording functionality
- ✅ Added hotkey support for start/stop recording

#### Week 2
- ✅ Integrated OpenAI Whisper API
- ✅ Created UI overlay for recording status
- ✅ Implemented basic error handling
- ✅ Added logging functionality

### Phase 2: Integration and Testing
#### Week 3
- ✅ Created integration tests
- ✅ Fixed hotkey manager cleanup issue
- ✅ Improved error handling for API calls
- ✅ Added recording overlay visibility

## Technical Decisions

### Audio Recording
- Using `sounddevice` for audio capture
- WAV format for temporary audio storage
- Implemented cleanup of temporary files

### Speech Recognition
- Using OpenAI Whisper API (`whisper-1` model)
- Considered alternatives:
  - Local Whisper models
  - Other speech recognition APIs

### UI/UX
- Minimalist overlay design
- Global hotkey support
- Non-intrusive feedback system

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Issues
- [ ] Recording overlay occasionally not visible
- [ ] Need better error handling for API rate limits
- [ ] Temporary file cleanup could be more robust

### Planned Features
- [ ] Support for multiple language detection
- [ ] Customizable hotkeys
- [ ] Persistent settings storage
- [ ] Advanced audio source selection

## Dependencies
